## Loading screens in Roblox are like randomness‚Äîtruly impossible.<br>But just as we have pseudorandom numbers, we can have pseudoloading screens.<br><br>This module gets as close to the real thing as possible.

# üöÄ Get Started

### 1. Import the module:
**‚Ä¢ Local download:**
1. Download the latest `.rbxm` file.  
2. Drag and drop the file from your file explorer into Roblox Studio.

**‚Ä¢  Creator store:**
1. Go to the creator store page for the module and press `Get Model`.  
2. Find and import the model from the toolbox inventory.

### 2. Parent the module to `ReplicatedFirst`
To ensure it appears during the loading phase, parent the module to `ReplicatedFirst`. This is the recommended location for any loading screen code.
<br>
<br>
### üí°Example use:
```lua
require(script.PseudoLoad)()
-- Everything below here happens after load.
print("Finished loading!")
```

# ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration</h1>
Before you use it, you may want to explore the optional configuration options.
<br><br>
**1. Inside of the main module you will find a submodule named `Configuration`.**

**2. Open it up and you'll see a few configuration options, which are explained to the best of my abiltity.**

**3. Once you've edited the values, you're good to go!**
