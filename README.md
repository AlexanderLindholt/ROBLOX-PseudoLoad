**But,** you might wonder why simulating a loading process is useful.

The answer is simple: **creating "real", accurate loading screens is basically impossible.**
<br><br/>

## üöÄGet started
1. Download the `.rbxm` file.
2. Drag and drop the file from your file explorer into Roblox Studio.
3. Parent the module to ReplicatedFirst to ensure it appears during the loading phase. This is the recommended location for any loading screen code.

üí°**Below is a simple example use of the module.**
```lua
require(script.PseudoLoad)() -- will yield.

print("Finished loading!")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration
Before you use it, you may want to explore the optional configuration options.

Inside of the main module you will find a submodule named `Configuration`.
Open it up and you'll see a few configuration options, which are explained to the best of my abiltity.
Once you've edited the values, you're good to go!
